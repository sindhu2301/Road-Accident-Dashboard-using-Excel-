# ROAD ACCIDENT DASHBOARD USING EXCEL

The objective of my Excel project was to improve my proficiency  for data cleaning, data processing,data analysis, and data visualization to show the insights of dashboard. 
## Data Gathering & Cleaning

1.Data Gathering:

For my Excel project, I downloaded the dataset in its raw format, which was provided in a excel file. 

2.Data Cleaning: 
     
In the initial stage of the project, I performed data cleaning tasks. I converted the raw dataset into an Excel table and applied filters to all columns to ensure easy navigation and data integrity. This also allows the table to automatically expand and update when new data is added in the future, preventing errors.

Next, I checked the dataset for any duplicate values and empty columns. I also corrected spelling inconsistencies in the "Accident Severity" column using the Find and Replace feature (Ctrl + F). The column originally contained misspelled values such as “fetal” instead of “fatal,” along with other variations like “slight” and “serious.” These were standardized to ensure consistency and accuracy in data analysis.

3.Data Processing:

In the data processing phase, one of the requirements was to show a trend line comparing casualties for the current year and the previous year. To achieve this, I created a new column to extract only the month from the date field. I used the TEXT function in Excel to separate the month and year into individual columns. This helped in grouping the data accurately for monthly trend analysis.



## Data analysis & Visualizations

   I converted my dataset into a Pivot Table to efficiently analyze and visualize the data. Based on the project requirements, I created reports and dashboards for the following key insights:

1.Primary and Secondary KPIs

2.Total casualties categorized by accident severity and vehicle type

3.Monthly trend comparisons for the years 2021 and 2022

4.Casualties distribution based on road surface conditions and road types

5.Insights by area/location and time of accident (day vs night)

## Conclusion

The Road Accident Dashboard project provided valuable insights into accident patterns across different parameters such as severity, vehicle type, road conditions, and time of occurrence. By analyzing and visualizing the data through Excel Pivot Tables and charts, I was able to identify key trends and high-risk factors. This project not only strengthened my skills in data cleaning, processing, and visualization using Excel but also highlighted the importance of data-driven decision-making in improving road safety.
